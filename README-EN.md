## Feature

- [x] Provides a default manager to support UICollectionView & UITableView.
- [x] You can customize the manager to support any view.
- [x] Empty page can be any kind of view.
- [x] You can set a custom manager to replace the default manager.
- [x] A custom manager can be set to globally replace the default manager.
- [x] We preloaded several sets of templates to make it easy to build empty pages.
- [x] We have a pre-configured set of state managers for non-networking or more.



## Usage

Here is a simple example of binding a custom view to a UICollectionview:

````swift
let customEmptyView = CustomEmptyView()
collectionView.ep.set(emptyView: customEmptyView)
````

After the `UICollectionview` executes `reloadData()` , EmptyPage determines whether the data in the Datasource is empty, and then decides whether to display the empty view.
